Amazon EventBridge delivers a near real-time stream of system events that
describe changes in AWS resources. For example, an AWS CodePipeline emits the
[State
Change](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/event-types.html#codepipeline-event-type)
event when the pipeline changes its state.

* **Events**: An event indicates a change in your AWS environment. AWS resources
  can generate events when their state changes. For example, Amazon EC2
  generates an event when the state of an EC2 instance changes from pending to
  running, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling generates events when it launches or
  terminates instances. AWS CloudTrail publishes events when you make API calls.
  You can generate custom application-level events and publish them to
  EventBridge. You can also set up scheduled events that are generated on
  a periodic basis. For a list of services that generate events, and sample
  events from each service, see [EventBridge Event Examples From Each
  Supported
  Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/event-types.html).
* **Targets**: A target processes events. Targets can include Amazon EC2
  instances, AWS Lambda functions, Kinesis streams, Amazon ECS tasks, Step
  Functions state machines, Amazon SNS topics, Amazon SQS queues, Amazon CloudWatch LogGroups, and built-in
  targets. A target receives events in JSON format.
* **Rules**: A rule matches incoming events and routes them to targets for
  processing. A single rule can route to multiple targets, all of which are
  processed in parallel. Rules are not processed in a particular order. This
  enables different parts of an organization to look for and process the events
  that are of interest to them. A rule can customize the JSON sent to the
  target, by passing only certain parts or by overwriting it with a constant.
* **EventBuses**: An event bus can receive events from your own custom applications
  or it can receive events from applications and services created by AWS SaaS partners.
  See [Creating an Event Bus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-event-bus.html).

## Rule

The `Rule` construct defines an EventBridge rule which monitors an
event based on an [event
pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/filtering-examples-structure.html)
and invoke **event targets** when the pattern is matched against a triggered
event. Event targets are objects that implement the `IRuleTarget` interface.

Normally, you will use one of the `source.onXxx(name[, target[, options]]) -> Rule` methods on the event source to define an event rule associated with
the specific activity. You can targets either via props, or add targets using
`rule.addTarget`.

For example, to define an rule that triggers a CodeBuild project build when a
commit is pushed to the "master" branch of a CodeCommit repository:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# repo is of type Repository
# project is of type Project


on_commit_rule = repo.on_commit("OnCommit",
    target=targets.CodeBuildProject(project),
    branches=["master"]
)
```

You can add additional targets, with optional [input
transformer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_InputTransformer.html)
using `eventRule.addTarget(target[, input])`. For example, we can add a SNS
topic target which formats a human-readable message for the commit.

For example, this adds an SNS topic as a target:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# on_commit_rule is of type events.Rule
# topic is of type Topic


on_commit_rule.add_target(targets.SnsTopic(topic,
    message=events.RuleTargetInput.from_text(f"A commit was pushed to the repository {codecommit.ReferenceEvent.repositoryName} on branch {codecommit.ReferenceEvent.referenceName}")
))
```

Or using an Object:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# on_commit_rule is of type events.Rule
# topic is of type Topic


on_commit_rule.add_target(targets.SnsTopic(topic,
    message=events.RuleTargetInput.from_object(
        DataType=f"custom_{events.EventField.fromPath('$.detail-type')}"
    )
))
```

## Scheduling

You can configure a Rule to run on a schedule (cron or rate).
Rate must be specified in minutes, hours or days.

The following example runs a task every day at 4am:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.aws_events import Rule, Schedule
from aws_cdk.aws_events_targets import EcsTask
from aws_cdk.aws_ecs import Cluster, TaskDefinition
from aws_cdk.aws_iam import Role

# cluster is of type Cluster
# task_definition is of type TaskDefinition
# role is of type Role


ecs_task_target = EcsTask(cluster=cluster, task_definition=task_definition, role=role)

Rule(self, "ScheduleRule",
    schedule=Schedule.cron(minute="0", hour="4"),
    targets=[ecs_task_target]
)
```

If you want to specify Fargate platform version, set `platformVersion` in EcsTask's props like the following example:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# cluster is of type ecs.Cluster
# task_definition is of type ecs.TaskDefinition
# role is of type Role


platform_version = ecs.FargatePlatformVersion.VERSION1_4
ecs_task_target = targets.EcsTask(cluster=cluster, task_definition=task_definition, role=role, platform_version=platform_version)
```

## Event Targets

The `@aws-cdk/aws-events-targets` module includes classes that implement the `IRuleTarget`
interface for various AWS services.

The following targets are supported:

* `targets.CodeBuildProject`: Start an AWS CodeBuild build
* `targets.CodePipeline`: Start an AWS CodePipeline pipeline execution
* `targets.EcsTask`: Start a task on an Amazon ECS cluster
* `targets.LambdaFunction`: Invoke an AWS Lambda function
* `targets.SnsTopic`: Publish into an SNS topic
* `targets.SqsQueue`: Send a message to an Amazon SQS Queue
* `targets.SfnStateMachine`: Trigger an AWS Step Functions state machine
* `targets.BatchJob`: Queue an AWS Batch Job
* `targets.AwsApi`: Make an AWS API call

### Cross-account and cross-region targets

It's possible to have the source of the event and a target in separate AWS accounts and regions:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.core import App, Stack
import aws_cdk.aws_codebuild as codebuild
import aws_cdk.aws_codecommit as codecommit
import aws_cdk.aws_events_targets as targets

app = App()

account1 = "11111111111"
account2 = "22222222222"

stack1 = Stack(app, "Stack1", env=Environment(account=account1, region="us-west-1"))
repo = codecommit.Repository(stack1, "Repository",
    repository_name="myrepository"
)

stack2 = Stack(app, "Stack2", env=Environment(account=account2, region="us-east-1"))
project = codebuild.Project(stack2, "Project")

repo.on_commit("OnCommit",
    target=targets.CodeBuildProject(project)
)
```

In this situation, the CDK will wire the 2 accounts together:

* It will generate a rule in the source stack with the event bus of the target account as the target
* It will generate a rule in the target stack, with the provided target
* It will generate a separate stack that gives the source account permissions to publish events
  to the event bus of the target account in the given region,
  and make sure its deployed before the source stack

For more information, see the
[AWS documentation on cross-account events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html).

## Archiving

It is possible to archive all or some events sent to an event bus. It is then possible to [replay these events](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-archive-and-replay-events-with-amazon-eventbridge/).

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
bus = events.EventBus(self, "bus",
    event_bus_name="MyCustomEventBus"
)

bus.archive("MyArchive",
    archive_name="MyCustomEventBusArchive",
    description="MyCustomerEventBus Archive",
    event_pattern={
        "account": [Stack.of(self).account]
    },
    retention=Duration.days(365)
)
```

## Granting PutEvents to an existing EventBus

To import an existing EventBus into your CDK application, use `EventBus.fromEventBusArn`, `EventBus.fromEventBusAttributes`
or `EventBus.fromEventBusName` factory method.

Then, you can use the `grantPutEventsTo` method to grant `event:PutEvents` to the eventBus.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# lambda_function is of type lambda.Function


event_bus = events.EventBus.from_event_bus_arn(self, "ImportedEventBus", "arn:aws:events:us-east-1:111111111:event-bus/my-event-bus")

# now you can just call methods on the eventbus
event_bus.grant_put_events_to(lambda_function)
```
