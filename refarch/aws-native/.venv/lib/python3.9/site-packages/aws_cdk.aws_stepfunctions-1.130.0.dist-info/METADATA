The `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions` package contains constructs for building
serverless workflows using objects. Use this in conjunction with the
`@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` package, which contains classes used
to call other AWS services.

Defining a workflow looks like this (for the [Step Functions Job Poller
example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/job-status-poller-sample.html)):

## Example

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda as lambda_

# submit_lambda is of type Function
# get_status_lambda is of type Function


submit_job = tasks.LambdaInvoke(self, "Submit Job",
    lambda_function=submit_lambda,
    # Lambda's result is in the attribute `Payload`
    output_path="$.Payload"
)

wait_x = sfn.Wait(self, "Wait X Seconds",
    time=sfn.WaitTime.seconds_path("$.waitSeconds")
)

get_status = tasks.LambdaInvoke(self, "Get Job Status",
    lambda_function=get_status_lambda,
    # Pass just the field named "guid" into the Lambda, put the
    # Lambda's result in a field called "status" in the response
    input_path="$.guid",
    output_path="$.Payload"
)

job_failed = sfn.Fail(self, "Job Failed",
    cause="AWS Batch Job Failed",
    error="DescribeJob returned FAILED"
)

final_status = tasks.LambdaInvoke(self, "Get Final Job Status",
    lambda_function=get_status_lambda,
    # Use "guid" field as input
    input_path="$.guid",
    output_path="$.Payload"
)

definition = submit_job.next(wait_x).next(get_status).next(sfn.Choice(self, "Job Complete?").when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.status", "FAILED"), job_failed).when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.status", "SUCCEEDED"), final_status).otherwise(wait_x))

sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition,
    timeout=Duration.minutes(5)
)
```

You can find more sample snippets and learn more about the service integrations
in the `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` package.

## State Machine

A `stepfunctions.StateMachine` is a resource that takes a state machine
definition. The definition is specified by its start state, and encompasses
all states reachable from the start state:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
start_state = sfn.Pass(self, "StartState")

sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=start_state
)
```

State machines execute using an IAM Role, which will automatically have all
permissions added that are required to make all state machine tasks execute
properly (for example, permissions to invoke any Lambda functions you add to
your workflow). A role will be created by default, but you can supply an
existing one as well.

## Amazon States Language

This library comes with a set of classes that model the [Amazon States
Language](https://states-language.net/spec.html). The following State classes
are supported:

* [`Task`](#task)
* [`Pass`](#pass)
* [`Wait`](#wait)
* [`Choice`](#choice)
* [`Parallel`](#parallel)
* [`Succeed`](#succeed)
* [`Fail`](#fail)
* [`Map`](#map)
* [`Custom State`](#custom-state)

An arbitrary JSON object (specified at execution start) is passed from state to
state and transformed during the execution of the workflow. For more
information, see the States Language spec.

### Task

A `Task` represents some work that needs to be done. The exact work to be
done is determine by a class that implements `IStepFunctionsTask`, a collection
of which can be found in the `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` module.

The tasks in the `@aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions-tasks` module support the
[service integration pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html) that integrates Step Functions with services
directly in the Amazon States language.

### Pass

A `Pass` state passes its input to its output, without performing work.
Pass states are useful when constructing and debugging state machines.

The following example injects some fixed data into the state machine through
the `result` field. The `result` field will be added to the input and the result
will be passed as the state's output.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Makes the current JSON state { ..., "subObject": { "hello": "world" } }
pass = sfn.Pass(self, "Add Hello World",
    result=sfn.Result.from_object(hello="world"),
    result_path="$.subObject"
)

# Set the next state
next_state = sfn.Pass(self, "NextState")
pass.next(next_state)
```

The `Pass` state also supports passing key-value pairs as input. Values can
be static, or selected from the input with a path.

The following example filters the `greeting` field from the state input
and also injects a field called `otherData`.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
pass = sfn.Pass(self, "Filter input and inject data",
    parameters={ # input to the pass state
        "input": sfn.JsonPath.string_at("$.input.greeting"),
        "other_data": "some-extra-stuff"}
)
```

The object specified in `parameters` will be the input of the `Pass` state.
Since neither `Result` nor `ResultPath` are supplied, the `Pass` state copies
its input through to its output.

Learn more about the [Pass state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-pass-state.html)

### Wait

A `Wait` state waits for a given number of seconds, or until the current time
hits a particular time. The time to wait may be taken from the execution's JSON
state.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Wait until it's the time mentioned in the the state object's "triggerTime"
# field.
wait = sfn.Wait(self, "Wait For Trigger Time",
    time=sfn.WaitTime.timestamp_path("$.triggerTime")
)

# Set the next state
start_the_work = sfn.Pass(self, "StartTheWork")
wait.next(start_the_work)
```

### Choice

A `Choice` state can take a different path through the workflow based on the
values in the execution's JSON state:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
choice = sfn.Choice(self, "Did it work?")

# Add conditions with .when()
success_state = sfn.Pass(self, "SuccessState")
failure_state = sfn.Pass(self, "FailureState")
choice.when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.status", "SUCCESS"), success_state)
choice.when(sfn.Condition.number_greater_than("$.attempts", 5), failure_state)

# Use .otherwise() to indicate what should be done if none of the conditions match
try_again_state = sfn.Pass(self, "TryAgainState")
choice.otherwise(try_again_state)
```

If you want to temporarily branch your workflow based on a condition, but have
all branches come together and continuing as one (similar to how an `if ... then ... else` works in a programming language), use the `.afterwards()` method:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
choice = sfn.Choice(self, "What color is it?")
handle_blue_item = sfn.Pass(self, "HandleBlueItem")
handle_red_item = sfn.Pass(self, "HandleRedItem")
handle_other_item_color = sfn.Pass(self, "HanldeOtherItemColor")
choice.when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.color", "BLUE"), handle_blue_item)
choice.when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.color", "RED"), handle_red_item)
choice.otherwise(handle_other_item_color)

# Use .afterwards() to join all possible paths back together and continue
ship_the_item = sfn.Pass(self, "ShipTheItem")
choice.afterwards().next(ship_the_item)
```

If your `Choice` doesn't have an `otherwise()` and none of the conditions match
the JSON state, a `NoChoiceMatched` error will be thrown. Wrap the state machine
in a `Parallel` state if you want to catch and recover from this.

### Parallel

A `Parallel` state executes one or more subworkflows in parallel. It can also
be used to catch and recover from errors in subworkflows.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
parallel = sfn.Parallel(self, "Do the work in parallel")

# Add branches to be executed in parallel
ship_item = sfn.Pass(self, "ShipItem")
send_invoice = sfn.Pass(self, "SendInvoice")
restock = sfn.Pass(self, "Restock")
parallel.branch(ship_item)
parallel.branch(send_invoice)
parallel.branch(restock)

# Retry the whole workflow if something goes wrong
parallel.add_retry(max_attempts=1)

# How to recover from errors
send_failure_notification = sfn.Pass(self, "SendFailureNotification")
parallel.add_catch(send_failure_notification)

# What to do in case everything succeeded
close_order = sfn.Pass(self, "CloseOrder")
parallel.next(close_order)
```

### Succeed

Reaching a `Succeed` state terminates the state machine execution with a
successful status.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
success = sfn.Succeed(self, "We did it!")
```

### Fail

Reaching a `Fail` state terminates the state machine execution with a
failure status. The fail state should report the reason for the failure.
Failures can be caught by encompassing `Parallel` states.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
success = sfn.Fail(self, "Fail",
    error="WorkflowFailure",
    cause="Something went wrong"
)
```

### Map

A `Map` state can be used to run a set of steps for each element of an input array.
A `Map` state will execute the same steps for multiple entries of an array in the state input.

While the `Parallel` state executes multiple branches of steps using the same input, a `Map` state will
execute the same steps for multiple entries of an array in the state input.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
map = sfn.Map(self, "Map State",
    max_concurrency=1,
    items_path=sfn.JsonPath.string_at("$.inputForMap")
)
map.iterator(sfn.Pass(self, "Pass State"))
```

### Custom State

It's possible that the high-level constructs for the states or `stepfunctions-tasks` do not have
the states or service integrations you are looking for. The primary reasons for this lack of
functionality are:

* A [service integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-service-integrations.html) is available through Amazon States Langauge, but not available as construct
  classes in the CDK.
* The state or state properties are available through Step Functions, but are not configurable
  through constructs

If a feature is not available, a `CustomState` can be used to supply any Amazon States Language
JSON-based object as the state definition.

[Code Snippets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-code-snippet.html#tutorial-code-snippet-1) are available and can be plugged in as the state definition.

Custom states can be chained together with any of the other states to create your state machine
definition. You will also need to provide any permissions that are required to the `role` that
the State Machine uses.

The following example uses the `DynamoDB` service integration to insert data into a DynamoDB table.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_dynamodb as dynamodb


# create a table
table = dynamodb.Table(self, "montable",
    partition_key=Attribute(
        name="id",
        type=dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING
    )
)

final_status = sfn.Pass(self, "final step")

# States language JSON to put an item into DynamoDB
# snippet generated from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-code-snippet.html#tutorial-code-snippet-1
state_json = {
    "Type": "Task",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::dynamodb:putItem",
    "Parameters": {
        "TableName": table.table_name,
        "Item": {
            "id": {
                "S": "MyEntry"
            }
        }
    },
    "ResultPath": null
}

# custom state which represents a task to insert data into DynamoDB
custom = sfn.CustomState(self, "my custom task",
    state_json=state_json
)

chain = sfn.Chain.start(custom).next(final_status)

sm = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=chain,
    timeout=Duration.seconds(30)
)

# don't forget permissions. You need to assign them
table.grant_write_data(sm)
```

## Task Chaining

To make defining work flows as convenient (and readable in a top-to-bottom way)
as writing regular programs, it is possible to chain most methods invocations.
In particular, the `.next()` method can be repeated. The result of a series of
`.next()` calls is called a **Chain**, and can be used when defining the jump
targets of `Choice.on` or `Parallel.branch`:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
step1 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step1")
step2 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step2")
step3 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step3")
step4 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step4")
step5 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step5")
step6 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step6")
step7 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step7")
step8 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step8")
step9 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step9")
step10 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step10")
choice = sfn.Choice(self, "Choice")
condition1 = sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.status", "SUCCESS")
parallel = sfn.Parallel(self, "Parallel")
finish = sfn.Pass(self, "Finish")

definition = step1.next(step2).next(choice.when(condition1, step3.next(step4).next(step5)).otherwise(step6).afterwards()).next(parallel.branch(step7.next(step8)).branch(step9.next(step10))).next(finish)

sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)
```

If you don't like the visual look of starting a chain directly off the first
step, you can use `Chain.start`:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
step1 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step1")
step2 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step2")
step3 = sfn.Pass(self, "Step3")

definition = sfn.Chain.start(step1).next(step2).next(step3)
```

## State Machine Fragments

It is possible to define reusable (or abstracted) mini-state machines by
defining a construct that implements `IChainable`, which requires you to define
two fields:

* `startState: State`, representing the entry point into this state machine.
* `endStates: INextable[]`, representing the (one or more) states that outgoing
  transitions will be added to if you chain onto the fragment.

Since states will be named after their construct IDs, you may need to prefix the
IDs of states if you plan to instantiate the same state machine fragment
multiples times (otherwise all states in every instantiation would have the same
name).

The class `StateMachineFragment` contains some helper functions (like
`prefixStates()`) to make it easier for you to do this. If you define your state
machine as a subclass of this, it will be convenient to use:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.core import Construct, Stack
import aws_cdk.aws_stepfunctions as sfn
import aws_cdk.aws_stepfunctions_tasks as tasks

class MyJob(sfn.StateMachineFragment):

    def __init__(self, parent, id, *, jobFlavor):
        super().__init__(parent, id)

        choice = sfn.Choice(self, "Choice").when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.branch", "left"), sfn.Pass(self, "Left Branch")).when(sfn.Condition.string_equals("$.branch", "right"), sfn.Pass(self, "Right Branch"))

        # ...

        self.start_state = choice
        self.end_states = choice.afterwards().end_states

class MyStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope, id):
        super().__init__(scope, id)
        # Do 3 different variants of MyJob in parallel
        sfn.Parallel(self, "All jobs").branch(MyJob(self, "Quick", job_flavor="quick").prefix_states()).branch(MyJob(self, "Medium", job_flavor="medium").prefix_states()).branch(MyJob(self, "Slow", job_flavor="slow").prefix_states())
```

A few utility functions are available to parse state machine fragments.

* `State.findReachableStates`: Retrieve the list of states reachable from a given state.
* `State.findReachableEndStates`: Retrieve the list of end or terminal states reachable from a given state.

## Activity

**Activities** represent work that is done on some non-Lambda worker pool. The
Step Functions workflow will submit work to this Activity, and a worker pool
that you run yourself, probably on EC2, will pull jobs from the Activity and
submit the results of individual jobs back.

You need the ARN to do so, so if you use Activities be sure to pass the Activity
ARN into your worker pool:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
activity = sfn.Activity(self, "Activity")

# Read this CloudFormation Output from your application and use it to poll for work on
# the activity.
CfnOutput(self, "ActivityArn", value=activity.activity_arn)
```

### Activity-Level Permissions

Granting IAM permissions to an activity can be achieved by calling the `grant(principal, actions)` API:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
activity = sfn.Activity(self, "Activity")

role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
)

activity.grant(role, "states:SendTaskSuccess")
```

This will grant the IAM principal the specified actions onto the activity.

## Metrics

`Task` object expose various metrics on the execution of that particular task. For example,
to create an alarm on a particular task failing:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# task is of type sfn.Task

cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "TaskAlarm",
    metric=task.metric_failed(),
    threshold=1,
    evaluation_periods=1
)
```

There are also metrics on the complete state machine:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# state_machine is of type sfn.StateMachine

cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "StateMachineAlarm",
    metric=state_machine.metric_failed(),
    threshold=1,
    evaluation_periods=1
)
```

And there are metrics on the capacity of all state machines in your account:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "ThrottledAlarm",
    metric=sfn.StateTransitionMetric.metric_throttled_events(),
    threshold=10,
    evaluation_periods=2
)
```

## Error names

Step Functions identifies errors in the Amazon States Language using case-sensitive strings, known as error names.
The Amazon States Language defines a set of built-in strings that name well-known errors, all beginning with the `States.` prefix.

* `States.ALL` - A wildcard that matches any known error name.
* `States.Runtime` - An execution failed due to some exception that could not be processed. Often these are caused by errors at runtime, such as attempting to apply InputPath or OutputPath on a null JSON payload. A `States.Runtime` error is not retriable, and will always cause the execution to fail. A retry or catch on `States.ALL` will NOT catch States.Runtime errors.
* `States.DataLimitExceeded` - A States.DataLimitExceeded exception will be thrown for the following:

  * When the output of a connector is larger than payload size quota.
  * When the output of a state is larger than payload size quota.
  * When, after Parameters processing, the input of a state is larger than the payload size quota.
  * See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/limits-overview.html) to learn more about AWS Step Functions Quotas.
* `States.HeartbeatTimeout` - A Task state failed to send a heartbeat for a period longer than the HeartbeatSeconds value.
* `States.Timeout` - A Task state either ran longer than the TimeoutSeconds value, or failed to send a heartbeat for a period longer than the HeartbeatSeconds value.
* `States.TaskFailed`- A Task state failed during the execution. When used in a retry or catch, `States.TaskFailed` acts as a wildcard that matches any known error name except for `States.Timeout`.

## Logging

Enable logging to CloudWatch by passing a logging configuration with a
destination LogGroup:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_logs as logs


log_group = logs.LogGroup(self, "MyLogGroup")

sfn.StateMachine(self, "MyStateMachine",
    definition=sfn.Chain.start(sfn.Pass(self, "Pass")),
    logs=LogOptions(
        destination=log_group,
        level=sfn.LogLevel.ALL
    )
)
```

## X-Ray tracing

Enable X-Ray tracing for StateMachine:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
sfn.StateMachine(self, "MyStateMachine",
    definition=sfn.Chain.start(sfn.Pass(self, "Pass")),
    tracing_enabled=True
)
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-xray-tracing.html)
to learn more about AWS Step Functions's X-Ray support.

## State Machine Permission Grants

IAM roles, users, or groups which need to be able to work with a State Machine should be granted IAM permissions.

Any object that implements the `IGrantable` interface (has an associated principal) can be granted permissions by calling:

* `stateMachine.grantStartExecution(principal)` - grants the principal the ability to execute the state machine
* `stateMachine.grantRead(principal)` - grants the principal read access
* `stateMachine.grantTaskResponse(principal)` - grants the principal the ability to send task tokens to the state machine
* `stateMachine.grantExecution(principal, actions)` - grants the principal execution-level permissions for the IAM actions specified
* `stateMachine.grant(principal, actions)` - grants the principal state-machine-level permissions for the IAM actions specified

### Start Execution Permission

Grant permission to start an execution of a state machine by calling the `grantStartExecution()` API.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# definition is of type sfn.IChainable
role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
)
state_machine = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)

# Give role permission to start execution of state machine
state_machine.grant_start_execution(role)
```

The following permission is provided to a service principal by the `grantStartExecution()` API:

* `states:StartExecution` - to state machine

### Read Permissions

Grant `read` access to a state machine by calling the `grantRead()` API.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# definition is of type sfn.IChainable
role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
)
state_machine = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)

# Give role read access to state machine
state_machine.grant_read(role)
```

The following read permissions are provided to a service principal by the `grantRead()` API:

* `states:ListExecutions` - to state machine
* `states:ListStateMachines` - to state machine
* `states:DescribeExecution` - to executions
* `states:DescribeStateMachineForExecution` - to executions
* `states:GetExecutionHistory` - to executions
* `states:ListActivities` - to `*`
* `states:DescribeStateMachine` - to `*`
* `states:DescribeActivity` - to `*`

### Task Response Permissions

Grant permission to allow task responses to a state machine by calling the `grantTaskResponse()` API:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# definition is of type sfn.IChainable
role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
)
state_machine = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)

# Give role task response permissions to the state machine
state_machine.grant_task_response(role)
```

The following read permissions are provided to a service principal by the `grantRead()` API:

* `states:SendTaskSuccess` - to state machine
* `states:SendTaskFailure` - to state machine
* `states:SendTaskHeartbeat` - to state machine

### Execution-level Permissions

Grant execution-level permissions to a state machine by calling the `grantExecution()` API:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# definition is of type sfn.IChainable
role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
)
state_machine = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)

# Give role permission to get execution history of ALL executions for the state machine
state_machine.grant_execution(role, "states:GetExecutionHistory")
```

### Custom Permissions

You can add any set of permissions to a state machine by calling the `grant()` API.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# definition is of type sfn.IChainable
user = iam.User(self, "MyUser")
state_machine = sfn.StateMachine(self, "StateMachine",
    definition=definition
)

# give user permission to send task success to the state machine
state_machine.grant(user, "states:SendTaskSuccess")
```

## Import

Any Step Functions state machine that has been created outside the stack can be imported
into your CDK stack.

State machines can be imported by their ARN via the `StateMachine.fromStateMachineArn()` API

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
app = App()
stack = Stack(app, "MyStack")
sfn.StateMachine.from_state_machine_arn(stack, "ImportedStateMachine", "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:StateMachine2E01A3A5-N5TJppzoevKQ")
```
