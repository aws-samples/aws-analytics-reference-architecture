AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to ensure the trust and integrity of your code. Organizations validate code against
a digital signature to confirm that the code is unaltered and from a trusted publisher. For more information, see [What Is AWS
Signer?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html)

## Signing Platform

A signing platform is a predefined set of instructions that specifies the signature format and signing algorithms that AWS Signer should use
to sign a zip file. For more information go to [Signing Platforms in AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/gs-platform.html).

AWS Signer provides a pre-defined set of signing platforms. They are available in the CDK as -

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Platform.AWS_IOT_DEVICE_MANAGEMENT_SHA256_ECDSA
Platform.AWS_LAMBDA_SHA384_ECDSA
Platform.AMAZON_FREE_RTOS_TI_CC3220SF
Platform.AMAZON_FREE_RTOS_DEFAULT
```

## Signing Profile

A signing profile is a code-signing template that can be used to pre-define the signature specifications for a signing job.
A signing profile includes a signing platform to designate the file type to be signed, the signature format, and the signature algorithms.
For more information, visit [Signing Profiles in AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/gs-profile.html).

The following code sets up a signing profile for signing lambda code bundles -

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_signer as signer

signing_profile = signer.SigningProfile(self, "SigningProfile",
    platform=signer.Platform.AWS_LAMBDA_SHA384_ECDSA
)
```

A signing profile is valid by default for 135 months. This can be modified by specifying the `signatureValidityPeriod` property.
