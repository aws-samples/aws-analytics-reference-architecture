Define a role and add permissions to it. This will automatically create and
attach an IAM policy to the role:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
role = Role(self, "MyRole",
    assumed_by=ServicePrincipal("sns.amazonaws.com")
)

role.add_to_policy(PolicyStatement(
    resources=["*"],
    actions=["lambda:InvokeFunction"]
))
```

Define a policy and attach it to groups, users and roles. Note that it is possible to attach
the policy either by calling `xxx.attachInlinePolicy(policy)` or `policy.attachToXxx(xxx)`.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = User(self, "MyUser", password=cdk.SecretValue.plain_text("1234"))
group = Group(self, "MyGroup")

policy = Policy(self, "MyPolicy")
policy.attach_to_user(user)
group.attach_inline_policy(policy)
```

Managed policies can be attached using `xxx.addManagedPolicy(ManagedPolicy.fromAwsManagedPolicyName(policyName))`:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
group = Group(self, "MyGroup")
group.add_managed_policy(ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("AdministratorAccess"))
```

## Granting permissions to resources

Many of the AWS CDK resources have `grant*` methods that allow you to grant other resources access to that resource. As an example, the following code gives a Lambda function write permissions (Put, Update, Delete) to a DynamoDB table.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# fn is of type lambda.Function
# table is of type Table


table.grant_write_data(fn)
```

The more generic `grant` method allows you to give specific permissions to a resource:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# fn is of type lambda.Function
# table is of type Table


table.grant(fn, "dynamodb:PutItem")
```

The `grant*` methods accept an `IGrantable` object. This interface is implemented by IAM principlal resources (groups, users and roles) and resources that assume a role such as a Lambda function, EC2 instance or a Codebuild project.

You can find which `grant*` methods exist for a resource in the [AWS CDK API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html).

## Roles

Many AWS resources require *Roles* to operate. These Roles define the AWS API
calls an instance or other AWS service is allowed to make.

Creating Roles and populating them with the right permissions *Statements* is
a necessary but tedious part of setting up AWS infrastructure. In order to
help you focus on your business logic, CDK will take care of creating
roles and populating them with least-privilege permissions automatically.

All constructs that require Roles will create one for you if don't specify
one at construction time. Permissions will be added to that role
automatically if you associate the construct with other constructs from the
AWS Construct Library (for example, if you tell an *AWS CodePipeline* to trigger
an *AWS Lambda Function*, the Pipeline's Role will automatically get
`lambda:InvokeFunction` permissions on that particular Lambda Function),
or if you explicitly grant permissions using `grant` functions (see the
previous section).

### Opting out of automatic permissions management

You may prefer to manage a Role's permissions yourself instead of having the
CDK automatically manage them for you. This may happen in one of the
following cases:

* You don't like the permissions that CDK automatically generates and
  want to substitute your own set.
* The least-permissions policy that the CDK generates is becoming too
  big for IAM to store, and you need to add some wildcards to keep the
  policy size down.

To prevent constructs from updating your Role's policy, pass the object
returned by `myRole.withoutPolicyUpdates()` instead of `myRole` itself.

For example, to have an AWS CodePipeline *not* automatically add the required
permissions to trigger the expected targets, do the following:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("codepipeline.amazonaws.com"),
    # custom description if desired
    description="This is a custom role..."
)

codepipeline.Pipeline(self, "Pipeline",
    # Give the Pipeline an immutable view of the Role
    role=role.without_policy_updates()
)

# You now have to manage the Role policies yourself
role.add_to_policy(iam.PolicyStatement(
    actions=[],
    resources=[]
))
```

### Using existing roles

If there are Roles in your account that have already been created which you
would like to use in your CDK application, you can use `Role.fromRoleArn` to
import them, as follows:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
role = iam.Role.from_role_arn(self, "Role", "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyExistingRole",
    # Set 'mutable' to 'false' to use the role as-is and prevent adding new
    # policies to it. The default is 'true', which means the role may be
    # modified as part of the deployment.
    mutable=False
)
```

## Configuring an ExternalId

If you need to create Roles that will be assumed by third parties, it is generally a good idea to [require an `ExternalId`
to assume them](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).  Configuring
an `ExternalId` works like this:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
role = iam.Role(self, "MyRole",
    assumed_by=iam.AccountPrincipal("123456789012"),
    external_ids=["SUPPLY-ME"]
)
```

## Principals vs Identities

When we say *Principal*, we mean an entity you grant permissions to. This
entity can be an AWS Service, a Role, or something more abstract such as "all
users in this account" or even "all users in this organization". An
*Identity* is an IAM representing a single IAM entity that can have
a policy attached, one of `Role`, `User`, or `Group`.

## IAM Principals

When defining policy statements as part of an AssumeRole policy or as part of a
resource policy, statements would usually refer to a specific IAM principal
under `Principal`.

IAM principals are modeled as classes that derive from the `iam.PolicyPrincipal`
abstract class. Principal objects include principal type (string) and value
(array of string), optional set of conditions and the action that this principal
requires when it is used in an assume role policy document.

To add a principal to a policy statement you can either use the abstract
`statement.addPrincipal`, one of the concrete `addXxxPrincipal` methods:

* `addAwsPrincipal`, `addArnPrincipal` or `new ArnPrincipal(arn)` for `{ "AWS": arn }`
* `addAwsAccountPrincipal` or `new AccountPrincipal(accountId)` for `{ "AWS": account-arn }`
* `addServicePrincipal` or `new ServicePrincipal(service)` for `{ "Service": service }`
* `addAccountRootPrincipal` or `new AccountRootPrincipal()` for `{ "AWS": { "Ref: "AWS::AccountId" } }`
* `addCanonicalUserPrincipal` or `new CanonicalUserPrincipal(id)` for `{ "CanonicalUser": id }`
* `addFederatedPrincipal` or `new FederatedPrincipal(federated, conditions, assumeAction)` for
  `{ "Federated": arn }` and a set of optional conditions and the assume role action to use.
* `addAnyPrincipal` or `new AnyPrincipal` for `{ "AWS": "*" }`

If multiple principals are added to the policy statement, they will be merged together:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
statement = iam.PolicyStatement()
statement.add_service_principal("cloudwatch.amazonaws.com")
statement.add_service_principal("ec2.amazonaws.com")
statement.add_arn_principal("arn:aws:boom:boom")
```

Will result in:

```json
{
  "Principal": {
    "Service": [ "cloudwatch.amazonaws.com", "ec2.amazonaws.com" ],
    "AWS": "arn:aws:boom:boom"
  }
}
```

The `CompositePrincipal` class can also be used to define complex principals, for example:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
role = iam.Role(self, "MyRole",
    assumed_by=iam.CompositePrincipal(
        iam.ServicePrincipal("ec2.amazonaws.com"),
        iam.AccountPrincipal("1818188181818187272"))
)
```

The `PrincipalWithConditions` class can be used to add conditions to a
principal, especially those that don't take a `conditions` parameter in their
constructor. The `principal.withConditions()` method can be used to create a
`PrincipalWithConditions` from an existing principal, for example:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
principal = iam.AccountPrincipal("123456789000").with_conditions({"StringEquals": {"foo": "baz"}})
```

> NOTE: If you need to define an IAM condition that uses a token (such as a
> deploy-time attribute of another resource) in a JSON map key, use `CfnJson` to
> render this condition. See [this test](./test/integ-condition-with-ref.ts) for
> an example.

The `WebIdentityPrincipal` class can be used as a principal for web identities like
Cognito, Amazon, Google or Facebook, for example:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
principal = iam.WebIdentityPrincipal("cognito-identity.amazonaws.com").with_conditions({
    "StringEquals": {"cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:aud": "us-east-2:12345678-abcd-abcd-abcd-123456"},
    "ForAnyValue:StringLike": {"cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:amr": "unauthenticated"}
})
```

## Parsing JSON Policy Documents

The `PolicyDocument.fromJson` and `PolicyStatement.fromJson` static methods can be used to parse JSON objects. For example:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
policy_document = {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "FirstStatement",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["iam:ChangePassword"],
        "Resource": "*"
    }, {
        "Sid": "SecondStatement",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "Resource": "*"
    }, {
        "Sid": "ThirdStatement",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:List*", "s3:Get*"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data", "arn:aws:s3:::confidential-data/*"
        ],
        "Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:_multi_factor_auth_present": "true"}}
    }
    ]
}

custom_policy_document = iam.PolicyDocument.from_json(policy_document)

# You can pass this document as an initial document to a ManagedPolicy
# or inline Policy.
new_managed_policy = iam.ManagedPolicy(self, "MyNewManagedPolicy",
    document=custom_policy_document
)
new_policy = iam.Policy(self, "MyNewPolicy",
    document=custom_policy_document
)
```

## Permissions Boundaries

[Permissions
Boundaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html)
can be used as a mechanism to prevent privilege esclation by creating new
`Role`s. Permissions Boundaries are a Managed Policy, attached to Roles or
Users, that represent the *maximum* set of permissions they can have. The
effective set of permissions of a Role (or User) will be the intersection of
the Identity Policy and the Permissions Boundary attached to the Role (or
User). Permissions Boundaries are typically created by account
Administrators, and their use on newly created `Role`s will be enforced by
IAM policies.

It is possible to attach Permissions Boundaries to all Roles created in a construct
tree all at once:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# Directly apply the boundary to a Role you create
# role is of type Role

# Apply the boundary to an Role that was implicitly created for you
# fn is of type lambda.Function

# Remove a Permissions Boundary that is inherited, for example from the Stack level
# custom_resource is of type CustomResource
# This imports an existing policy.
boundary = iam.ManagedPolicy.from_managed_policy_arn(self, "Boundary", "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/boundary")

# This creates a new boundary
boundary2 = iam.ManagedPolicy(self, "Boundary2",
    statements=[
        iam.PolicyStatement(
            effect=iam.Effect.DENY,
            actions=["iam:*"],
            resources=["*"]
        )
    ]
)
iam.PermissionsBoundary.of(role).apply(boundary)
iam.PermissionsBoundary.of(fn).apply(boundary)

# Apply the boundary to all Roles in a stack
iam.PermissionsBoundary.of(self).apply(boundary)
iam.PermissionsBoundary.of(custom_resource).clear()
```

## OpenID Connect Providers

OIDC identity providers are entities in IAM that describe an external identity
provider (IdP) service that supports the [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect) (OIDC) standard, such
as Google or Salesforce. You use an IAM OIDC identity provider when you want to
establish trust between an OIDC-compatible IdP and your AWS account. This is
useful when creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWS
resources, but you don't want to create custom sign-in code or manage your own
user identities. For more information about this scenario, see [About Web
Identity Federation] and the relevant documentation in the [Amazon Cognito
Identity Pools Developer Guide].

The following examples defines an OpenID Connect provider. Two client IDs
(audiences) are will be able to send authentication requests to
https://openid/connect.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
provider = iam.OpenIdConnectProvider(self, "MyProvider",
    url="https://openid/connect",
    client_ids=["myclient1", "myclient2"]
)
```

You can specify an optional list of `thumbprints`. If not specified, the
thumbprint of the root certificate authority (CA) will automatically be obtained
from the host as described
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc_verify-thumbprint.html).

Once you define an OpenID connect provider, you can use it with AWS services
that expect an IAM OIDC provider. For example, when you define an [Amazon
Cognito identity
pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/open-id.html)
you can reference the provider's ARN as follows:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_cognito as cognito

# my_provider is of type OpenIdConnectProvider

cognito.CfnIdentityPool(self, "IdentityPool",
    open_id_connect_provider_arns=[my_provider.open_id_connect_provider_arn],
    # And the other properties for your identity pool
    allow_unauthenticated_identities=False
)
```

The `OpenIdConnectPrincipal` class can be used as a principal used with a `OpenIdConnectProvider`, for example:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
provider = iam.OpenIdConnectProvider(self, "MyProvider",
    url="https://openid/connect",
    client_ids=["myclient1", "myclient2"]
)
principal = iam.OpenIdConnectPrincipal(provider)
```

## SAML provider

An IAM SAML 2.0 identity provider is an entity in IAM that describes an external
identity provider (IdP) service that supports the SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion
Markup Language 2.0) standard. You use an IAM identity provider when you want
to establish trust between a SAML-compatible IdP such as Shibboleth or Active
Directory Federation Services and AWS, so that users in your organization can
access AWS resources. IAM SAML identity providers are used as principals in an
IAM trust policy.

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
iam.SamlProvider(self, "Provider",
    metadata_document=iam.SamlMetadataDocument.from_file("/path/to/saml-metadata-document.xml")
)
```

The `SamlPrincipal` class can be used as a principal with a `SamlProvider`:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
provider = iam.SamlProvider(self, "Provider",
    metadata_document=iam.SamlMetadataDocument.from_file("/path/to/saml-metadata-document.xml")
)
principal = iam.SamlPrincipal(provider, {
    "StringEquals": {
        "SAML:iss": "issuer"
    }
})
```

When creating a role for programmatic and AWS Management Console access, use the `SamlConsolePrincipal`
class:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
provider = iam.SamlProvider(self, "Provider",
    metadata_document=iam.SamlMetadataDocument.from_file("/path/to/saml-metadata-document.xml")
)
iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.SamlConsolePrincipal(provider)
)
```

## Users

IAM manages users for your AWS account. To create a new user:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = iam.User(self, "MyUser")
```

To import an existing user by name [with path](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names):

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = iam.User.from_user_name(self, "MyImportedUserByName", "johnsmith")
```

To import an existing user by ARN:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = iam.User.from_user_arn(self, "MyImportedUserByArn", "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/johnsmith")
```

To import an existing user by attributes:

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = iam.User.from_user_attributes(self, "MyImportedUserByAttributes",
    user_arn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/johnsmith"
)
```

To add a user to a group (both for a new and imported user/group):

```python
# Example automatically generated. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
user = iam.User(self, "MyUser") # or User.fromUserName(stack, 'User', 'johnsmith');
group = iam.Group(self, "MyGroup") # or Group.fromGroupArn(stack, 'Group', 'arn:aws:iam::account-id:group/group-name');

user.add_to_group(group)
# or
group.add_user(user)
```

## Features

* Policy name uniqueness is enforced. If two policies by the same name are attached to the same
  principal, the attachment will fail.
* Policy names are not required - the CDK logical ID will be used and ensured to be unique.
* Policies are validated during synthesis to ensure that they have actions, and that policies
  attached to IAM principals specify relevant resources, while policies attached to resources
  specify which IAM principals they apply to.
