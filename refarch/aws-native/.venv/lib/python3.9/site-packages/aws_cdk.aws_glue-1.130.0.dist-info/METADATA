This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

## Job

A `Job` encapsulates a script that connects to data sources, processes them, and then writes output to a data target.

There are 3 types of jobs supported by AWS Glue: Spark ETL, Spark Streaming, and Python Shell jobs.

The `glue.JobExecutable` allows you to specify the type of job, the language to use and the code assets required by the job.

`glue.Code` allows you to refer to the different code assets required by the job, either from an existing S3 location or from a local file path.

### Spark Jobs

These jobs run in an Apache Spark environment managed by AWS Glue.

#### ETL Jobs

An ETL job processes data in batches using Apache Spark.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Job(stack, "ScalaSparkEtlJob",
    executable=glue.JobExecutable.scala_etl(
        glue_version=glue.GlueVersion.V2_0,
        script=glue.Code.from_bucket(bucket, "src/com/example/HelloWorld.scala"),
        class_name="com.example.HelloWorld",
        extra_jars=[glue.Code.from_bucket(bucket, "jars/HelloWorld.jar")]
    ),
    description="an example Scala ETL job"
)
```

#### Streaming Jobs

A Streaming job is similar to an ETL job, except that it performs ETL on data streams. It uses the Apache Spark Structured Streaming framework. Some Spark job features are not available to streaming ETL jobs.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Job(stack, "PythonSparkStreamingJob",
    executable=glue.JobExecutable.python_streaming(
        glue_version=glue.GlueVersion.V2_0,
        python_version=glue.PythonVersion.THREE,
        script=glue.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "job-script/hello_world.py"))
    ),
    description="an example Python Streaming job"
)
```

### Python Shell Jobs

A Python shell job runs Python scripts as a shell and supports a Python version that depends on the AWS Glue version you are using.
This can be used to schedule and run tasks that don't require an Apache Spark environment.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Job(stack, "PythonShellJob",
    executable=glue.JobExecutable.python_shell(
        glue_version=glue.GlueVersion.V1_0,
        python_version=PythonVersion.THREE,
        script=glue.Code.from_bucket(bucket, "script.py")
    ),
    description="an example Python Shell job"
)
```

See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html) for more information on adding jobs in Glue.

## Connection

A `Connection` allows Glue jobs, crawlers and development endpoints to access certain types of data stores. For example, to create a network connection to connect to a data source within a VPC:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Connection(stack, "MyConnection",
    connection_type=glue.ConnectionTypes.NETWORK,
    # The security groups granting AWS Glue inbound access to the data source within the VPC
    security_groups=[security_group],
    # The VPC subnet which contains the data source
    subnet=subnet
)
```

If you need to use a connection type that doesn't exist as a static member on `ConnectionType`, you can instantiate a `ConnectionType` object, e.g: `new glue.ConnectionType('NEW_TYPE')`.

See [Adding a Connection to Your Data Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/populate-add-connection.html) and [Connection Structure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-api-catalog-connections.html#aws-glue-api-catalog-connections-Connection) documentation for more information on the supported data stores and their configurations.

## SecurityConfiguration

A `SecurityConfiguration` is a set of security properties that can be used by AWS Glue to encrypt data at rest.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.SecurityConfiguration(stack, "MySecurityConfiguration",
    security_configuration_name="name",
    cloud_watch_encryption={
        "mode": glue.CloudWatchEncryptionMode.KMS
    },
    job_bookmarks_encryption={
        "mode": glue.JobBookmarksEncryptionMode.CLIENT_SIDE_KMS
    },
    s3_encryption={
        "mode": glue.S3EncryptionMode.KMS
    }
)
```

By default, a shared KMS key is created for use with the encryption configurations that require one. You can also supply your own key for each encryption config, for example, for CloudWatch encryption:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.SecurityConfiguration(stack, "MySecurityConfiguration",
    security_configuration_name="name",
    cloud_watch_encryption={
        "mode": glue.CloudWatchEncryptionMode.KMS,
        "kms_key": key
    }
)
```

See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/encryption-security-configuration.html) for more info for Glue encrypting data written by Crawlers, Jobs, and Development Endpoints.

## Database

A `Database` is a logical grouping of `Tables` in the Glue Catalog.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Database(stack, "MyDatabase",
    database_name="my_database"
)
```

## Table

A Glue table describes a table of data in S3: its structure (column names and types), location of data (S3 objects with a common prefix in a S3 bucket), and format for the files (Json, Avro, Parquet, etc.):

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    database=my_database,
    table_name="my_table",
    columns=[{
        "name": "col1",
        "type": glue.Schema.STRING
    }, {
        "name": "col2",
        "type": glue.Schema.array(Schema.STRING),
        "comment": "col2 is an array of strings"
    }],
    data_format=glue.DataFormat.JSON
)
```

By default, a S3 bucket will be created to store the table's data but you can manually pass the `bucket` and `s3Prefix`:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    bucket=my_bucket,
    s3_prefix="my-table/", ...
)
```

By default, an S3 bucket will be created to store the table's data and stored in the bucket root. You can also manually pass the `bucket` and `s3Prefix`:

### Partitions

To improve query performance, a table can specify `partitionKeys` on which data is stored and queried separately. For example, you might partition a table by `year` and `month` to optimize queries based on a time window:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    database=my_database,
    table_name="my_table",
    columns=[{
        "name": "col1",
        "type": glue.Schema.STRING
    }],
    partition_keys=[{
        "name": "year",
        "type": glue.Schema.SMALL_INT
    }, {
        "name": "month",
        "type": glue.Schema.SMALL_INT
    }],
    data_format=glue.DataFormat.JSON
)
```

## [Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/encryption.html)

You can enable encryption on a Table's data:

* `Unencrypted` - files are not encrypted. The default encryption setting.
* [S3Managed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) - Server side encryption (`SSE-S3`) with an Amazon S3-managed key.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    encryption=glue.TableEncryption.S3_MANAGED, ...
)
```

* [Kms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) - Server-side encryption (`SSE-KMS`) with an AWS KMS Key managed by the account owner.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# KMS key is created automatically
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    encryption=glue.TableEncryption.KMS, ...
)

# with an explicit KMS key
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    encryption=glue.TableEncryption.KMS,
    encryption_key=kms.Key(stack, "MyKey"), ...
)
```

* [KmsManaged](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) - Server-side encryption (`SSE-KMS`), like `Kms`, except with an AWS KMS Key managed by the AWS Key Management Service.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    encryption=glue.TableEncryption.KMS_MANAGED, ...
)
```

* [ClientSideKms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html#client-side-encryption-kms-managed-master-key-intro) - Client-side encryption (`CSE-KMS`) with an AWS KMS Key managed by the account owner.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
# KMS key is created automatically
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    encryption=glue.TableEncryption.CLIENT_SIDE_KMS, ...
)

# with an explicit KMS key
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    encryption=glue.TableEncryption.CLIENT_SIDE_KMS,
    encryption_key=kms.Key(stack, "MyKey"), ...
)
```

*Note: you cannot provide a `Bucket` when creating the `Table` if you wish to use server-side encryption (`KMS`, `KMS_MANAGED` or `S3_MANAGED`)*.

## Types

A table's schema is a collection of columns, each of which have a `name` and a `type`. Types are recursive structures, consisting of primitive and complex types:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
glue.Table(stack, "MyTable",
    columns=[{
        "name": "primitive_column",
        "type": glue.Schema.STRING
    }, {
        "name": "array_column",
        "type": glue.Schema.array(glue.Schema.INTEGER),
        "comment": "array<integer>"
    }, {
        "name": "map_column",
        "type": glue.Schema.map(glue.Schema.STRING, glue.Schema.TIMESTAMP),
        "comment": "map<string,string>"
    }, {
        "name": "struct_column",
        "type": glue.Schema.struct([
            name="nested_column",
            type=glue.Schema.DATE,
            comment="nested comment"
        ]),
        "comment": "struct<nested_column:date COMMENT 'nested comment'>"
    }], ...
```
