# AWS Analytics Reference Architecture

The AWS Analytics Reference Architecture is a set of analytics solutions put together as end-to-end examples.
It regroups AWS best practices for designing, implementing, and operating analytics platforms through different purpose-built patterns, handling common requirements, and solving customers' challenges.

This project is composed of:
 * Reusable core components exposed in an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) library currently available in [Typescript]() and [Python](). This library contains high level AWS CDK constructs that can be used to quickly provision analytics solutions in demos, prototypes, proof of concepts and end-to-end reference architectures. 
 * Reference architectures consumming the reusable components to demonstrate end-to-end examples in a business context
